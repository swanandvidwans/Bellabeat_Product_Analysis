/*
Some interesting discoveries from this summary:

Average sedentary time is 991 minutes or 16 hours. Definately needs to be reduced!
The majority of the participants are lightly active.
On the average, participants sleep 1 time for 7 hours.
Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits for according to the CDC research. They found that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps.
